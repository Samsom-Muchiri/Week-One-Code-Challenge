## Project Description
### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

The Student Grade Generator project is a program that allows users to input student marks and calculates the corresponding grade based on the input. The program prompts the user to enter the marks and determines the correct grade. This project helps automate the process of grading students' marks and provides an efficient way to determine the corresponding grade based on predefined criteria.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

The Speed Detector project is a program designed to monitor the speed of a car and determine if the driver has exceeded the speed limit. The program takes as input the speed of the car and checks if it is less than the speed limit. It calculates the number of demerit points the driver will receive if the speed exceeds the limit. This project helps enforce speed limits and promote safe driving practices.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

The Net Salary Calculator project is a program that calculates the net salary of an employee based on their basic salary and benefits. The program takes the employee's basic salary and additional benefits as input. It calculates various deductions such as Payee Tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions and determines the net salary. This project provides an efficient way to determine the employee's take-home pay after deducting taxes and social security contributions.
